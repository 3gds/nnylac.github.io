possible ideas:

    1. Portfolio
        - if done, I intend for this to be a CV of sorts when
        applying for uni internships and even NUS Investment Society
        - to include:
            a. As results including H3
            b. uni combi (assume major QF + minor phy + minor CS)
            c. courses I've taken:
                -CS50
                -CS50P
                -CS50R
                -fundmentals of quantitative modelling
            d. textbooks relevant to the uni courses i'm taking for:
                -introduction to quantitative finance
                -calculus
                -multivariable calculus
                -electricity & magnetism I

                -linear algebra
                -probability
                -regression analysis
                -numerical analysis I
        - i don't feel that a portfolio at this time will be able to
        provide much value for any possible applications in the near
        future. or rather, there isn't enough content to justify making
        a whole website just for this. Furthermore, there are many
        dedicated CV website templates out there that are definitely
        much more pretty to look at with much less effort.

    2. HSR Planner
        - general ideas:
            a. take reference from arknights krooster page

        - tool bar at top of all pages:
            a. characters
            b. relics
            c. teams

        - main page:
            a. Current banner with infographic and duration
            b. (animated) background (of FX?!)
            c. Upcoming banners with infographic and duration

        - character page:
            a. all characters (can be lazy and just include obtained ones first)
            b. each character upon clicked on will show a popup:
                i. OWN button (if so, character lights up in main page
                otherwise will remain dull)
                ii. Element
                iii. Path
                iv. Recommended (P2W & F2P) Lightcones (when selected, lights up)
                v. Recommended relic set(s) and substats
                vi. Actual relics with substats (choose from menu from Relics)

    3. Calynn's birthday present

        - Main page:
            a. "Happy Birthday Calynn" in big words across screen
            b. "Dedicated to my girlfriend" in small words across screen
            c. small menu at top right(present on all pages) to redirect to other pages

        - How we Met:
            a. JC photos "flowing" across screen horizontally
            b. "How We Met" in big words at top of screen
            c. some sort of old time black white aesthetic

        - Places we went:
            a. random outing photos "flowing" across screen horizontally
            b. "Places We Went" in big words at top of screen
            c. colourful, pink aesthetics

         - Our Third Wheel:
            a. random outing photos with xinyi "flowing" across screen horizontally
            b. "Our Third Wheel" in big words at top of screen
            c. literal wheel somewhere
            d. pink aesthetic as well but not as colourful as "Places we went"
